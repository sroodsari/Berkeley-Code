```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
data(starwars)
variables <- c("name", "height", "mass", "sex", "homeworld")
dat <- na.omit(starwars[ ,variables])
```


### General Instructions

- Write your descriptions, explanations, and code in an `Rmd` (R markdown) file.
- Name this file as `lab07-first-last.Rmd`, where `first` and `last` are your
first and last names (e.g. `lab07-gaston-sanchez.Rmd`).
- Knit your `Rmd` file as an html document (default option).
- Submit your `Rmd` and `html` files to bCourses, in the corresponding lab assignment.



## 1) Dataset `"starwars"`

Some weeks ago we looked at a couple of approaches to manipulate tables and create 
statistical graphics via `"dplyr"` and `"ggplot2"`. As you now know, the default 
object that R provides to handle data tables is the so called `data.frame`. 
It turns out that data frames are formed by a set of R vectors, which is the 
main topic of today's session.

In this lab, you are going to work with the data `starwars` from `"dplyr"`. 
This time however, we will focus on columns `name`, `height`, `mass`, `sex`, 
and `homeworld`, and we will also remove rows that contain missing values:


```{r eval = FALSE}
# include this chunk in your Rmd
library(tidyverse)
data(starwars)
variables <- c("name", "height", "mass", "sex", "homeworld")
dat <- na.omit(starwars[ ,variables])
```



## 2) Vectors

As we mention, data frames are (typically) made of vectors. Each column of a 
data frame corresponds to an R vector. So let's "break down" the table `dat` 
into five vectors:

```{r}
# creating 5 vectors (from columns in dat)
name <- dat$name

height <- dat$height

mass <- dat$mass

sex <- dat$sex

homeworld <- dat$homeworld
```

Use the function `typeof()` to see the data type of each of the above vectors.



### 2.1) Your turn: subsetting vectors

Create a vector `four` by selecting the first four elements in `name`:

```{r}
four <- head(name, n = 4)
four
```

Single brackets `[ ]` are used to subset (i.e. subscript, split, slice) vectors.
Without running the code, try to guess the output of the following commands, and 
then run them to check your guess:

- number one: `four[1]`
Luke Skywalker

```{r}
# your code
four[1]

```

- an index of zero: `four[0]`?
character(0)

```{r}
# your code
four[0]
```

- a negative index: `four[-1]`?
error -- incorrect
all but index 1

```{r}
# your code
four[-1]
```

- various negative indices: `four[-c(1,2,3)]`?
Darth Vader

```{r}
# your code
four[-c(1,2,3)]
```

- an index greater than the length of the vector: `four[5]`?
error - incorrect
NA

```{r}
# your code
four[5]
```

- repeated indices: `four[c(1,2,2,3,3,3)]`?
Luke Skywalker C-3PO C3PO R2D2 R2D2 R2D2

```{r}
# your code
four[c(1,2,2,3,3,3)]
```


Often, you will need to generate vectors of numeric sequences, like the first 
five elements `1:5`, or from the first till the last element `1:length(player)`. 
R provides the colon operator `:`, and the functions `seq()`, and `rep()` 
to create various types of sequences.


### 2.2) Your turn: sequences and repetitions

Figure out how to use `seq()`, `rep()`, `rev()`, and bracket notation, to extract:

- all the even elements in `name` (i.e. extract positions 2, 4, 6, etc)
```{r}
name[seq(from = 2, length(name), 2)]
```


- all the odd elements in `height` (i.e. extract positions 1, 3, 5, etc)
```{r}
height[seq(1,length(height),2)]
```

- all multiples of 5 (e.g. 5, 10, 15, etc) of `sex`
```{r}
sex[seq(5,length(sex), 5)]
```


- elements in positions 10, 20, 30, 40, etc of `mass`
```{r}
mass[seq(10, length(mass), 10)]
```


- all the even elements in `name` but this time in reverse order
```{r}
name[rev(seq(2, length(name), 2))]
```




## 3) Logical Subsetting and Comparisons

Another kind of subsetting/subscripting style is the so-called __logical subsetting__. This kind of subsetting typically takes place when making comparisons. 
A __comparison operation__ occurs when you use comparison operators such as: 

- `>` greater than
- `>=` greater than or equal
- `<` less than
- `<=` less than or equal
- `==` equal
- `!=` different

For example:

```r
height_four <- height[1:4]

# elements greater than 100
height_four[height_four > 100]

# elements less than 100
height_four[height_four < 100]

# elements less than or equal to 10
height_four[height_four <= 10]

# elements different from 10
height_four[height_four != 10]
```

In addition to using comparison operators, you can also use __logical operators__ to produce a logical vector. The most common type of logical operators are:

- `&` AND
- `|` OR
- `!` negation

Run the following commands to see what R does:

```r
# AND
TRUE & TRUE
TRUE & FALSE
FALSE & FALSE


# OR
TRUE | TRUE
TRUE | FALSE
FALSE | FALSE

# NOT
!TRUE
!FALSE
```
```{r}
TRUE | FALSE
```

Logical operators allow you to combine several comparisons:

```r
# vectors for first 10 elements
name10 <- name[1:10]
height10 <- height[1:10]
mass10 <- mass[1:10]
sex10 <- sex[1:10]

# names of first 10 individuals with mass greater than 70kg
name10[mass10 > 70]

# names of first 10 individuals with heights between 150 and 200 (exclusive)
name10[height10 > 150 & height10 < 200]
```


### 3.1) Your turn: logical subsetting

Write commands, using bracket notation, to answer the following questions 
(you may need to use `is.na()`, `min()`, `max()`, `which()`, `which.min()`, `which.max()`):

- name of individuals from homeworld Naboo

```{r}
# your code
name[homeworld == "Naboo"]
```

- name of individuals from homeworlds Naboo or Corellia

```{r}
# your code
name[homeworld == "Naboo" | homeworld == "Corellia"]
```

- name of female individuals

```{r}
# your code
name[sex == 'female']
```

- name of individual with largest mass

```{r}
# your code
name[which.max(mass)]
```

- largest height of all females

```{r}
# your code
max(height[sex=="female"])
```

- name of individual(s) with height equal to the median height

```{r}
# your code
medianHeight = median(height, na.rm = FALSE)
name[height == medianHeight]
```

- name of individual(s) with height of at most 180, and mass of at least 120 

```{r}
# your code
name[height<=180 & mass >=120]
```



## 4) Factors

As mentioned before, vectors are the most essential type of data structure
in R. They are _atomic_ structures (can contain only one type of data):
integers, real numbers, logical values, characters, complex numbers.

Related to vectors, there is another important data structure in R called
__factor__. Internally, an R `factor` is stored as an interger vector, and 
most operations that apply to vectors also apply to factors. The conceptual 
difference between a vector and a factor is that factors are data structures 
exclusively designed to handle categorical data.


### 4.1) Creating Factors

Use `factor()` to create an object `sex_fac` by converting `sex` into a factor:

```{r}
sex_fac <- factor(sex)
```

If you have a factor, you can invoke `table()` to get a table with the 
frequencies (i.e. counts) of the factor categories or _levels_:

```{r}
table(sex_fac)
```



### 4.2) Your turn: Manipulating Factors

Because factors are internally stored as integers, you can manipulate factors
as any other vector:

```{r}
sex_fac[1:5]
```

Practice manipulating `gender_fac` to get:

- sex of individuals from homeworld Naboo

```{r}
# your code
factor(sex[homeworld == "Naboo"])


```

- sex of individuals with mass > 80 kg

```{r}
# your code
factor(sex[mass >80])
```

- use `table()` to get the frequencies (counts) of sex with height > 180

```{r}
# your code
table(factor(sex[height >180]))
```

- use `table()` to get the frequencies (counts) of 'male' in each homeworld

```{r}
# your code
table(factor(homeworld[sex == 'male']))
```




## 5) Matrices

A vector can be extended into a 2-dimensional object in the form of a __matrix__ 
(which is a 2-dimensional array).

For instance, let's create a matrix with the `height` and `mass` values of the 
first five individuals:

```{r}
# matrix with height and mass of first 5 individuals
HM <- matrix(c(height[1:5], mass[1:5]), nrow = 5, ncol = 2)
HM
```

You can give names to rows and columns with the functions `rownames()` and `colnames()`:

```{r}
rownames(HM) <- name[1:5]
colnames(HM) <- c("height", "mass")
HM
```


### 5.1) Your Turn

- Use the column-binding function `cbind()` to create a matrix `MH` with columns `mass` and `height`, for the first 10 individuals.

```{r}
# your code
MH = cbind(mass[1:10], height[1:10])
MH
```

- Use the function `matrix()` to create a matrix `females` with `mass` and `height` values for female individuals.

```{r}
# your code
females = matrix(c(mass[sex == 'female'], height[sex == 'female']), ncol = 2)
females
```

- Give names to the rows and columns of the matrix `females` created above.

```{r}
# your code
rownames(females) = name[sex == 'female']
colnames(females) = c("mass", "height")
females
```

- If you create a matrix `MHW` by combining `mass`, `height` and `homeworld` for all individuals, what is the resulting data type---returned by `typeof()`--- of `MHW`?

```{r}
# your code
MHW = cbind(mass, height, homeworld)
typeof(MHW)
```
character
