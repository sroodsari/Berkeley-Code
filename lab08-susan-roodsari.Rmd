#```

### General Instructions

- Write your descriptions, explanations, and code in an `Rmd` (R markdown) file.
- Name this file as `lab08-first-last.Rmd`, where `first` and `last` are your
first and last names (e.g. `lab08-gaston-sanchez.Rmd`).
- Knit your `Rmd` file as an html document (default option).
- Submit your `Rmd` and `html` files to bCourses, in the corresponding lab assignment.



## 1) Introduction

In this lab you will practice writing simple functions, and some basic examples
to make sure that the functions work as expected. Later in the course we will
see how to write assertions (i.e. tests) for your functions in a more formal 
way. 

In addition to writing the functions, you should also practice documenting your 
functions. Writing this type of documentation should become second nature.
To do this, include roxygen comments such as:

- `#' @title Name of your function`
- `#' @description What the function does`
- `#' @param x input(s) of your function`
- `#' @return output of your function`


### 1.1) Before you start ...

If you use an `Rmd` file to write narrative and code for this practice, you must 
include a code chunk at the top of your file like the one in the following 
screen capture:

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE, error=TRUE)
```

By setting the global option `error = TRUE` you avoid the knitting process 
to be stopped in case a code chunk generates an error.

Since you willl be writing a couple of functions with `stop()` statements,
it is essential that you set up `error = TRUE`, otherwise `"knitr"` will 
stop knitting your `Rmd` file if it encounters an error.


### 1.2) Toy Example

Here's an example of a function `rect_area()` that computes the area of a rectangle. Notice the structure of the code below: the first lines correspond to the documentation of the function using Roxygen comments; and then you have the actual code of the function `rect_area()`:

```{r}
#' @title area of rectangle
#' @description calculates the area of a rectangle
#' @param len length of the rectangle (numeric)
#' @param wid width of the rectangle (numeric)
#' @return computed area
rect_area <- function(len = 1, wid = 1) {
  if (len < 0) {
    stop("len must be positive")
  }
  if (wid < 0) {
    stop("wid must be positive")
  }
  area <- len * wid
  return(area)
}
```

Once the function has been created, we can test it with a couple of basic examples:

```{r}
# default
rect_area()

# len=2, wid=3
rect_area(len = 2, wid = 3)

# bad len
rect_area(len = -2, wid = 3)
```

## 2) Polynomials

In this problem we want to see whether the graph of a given polynomial
will cross or touch the _x_ axis in a given interval. 

Let's begin with the polynomial: 

$$
f(x) = x^2 - 1
$$

The first thing to do is write a function for the polynomial, for instance:

```{r}
poly1 <- function(x) {
  x^2 - 1
}
```

Once you have a function for the polynomial, you can create a set of pairs of
points $x$ and $y = f(x)$, and then use them to graph the polynomial

```{r polynomial_plot}
# set of points
x <- seq(-4, 4, length.out = 50)
y <- poly1(x)

# graph polynomial
plot(x, y, type = 'l', lwd = 3, col = "#FB7215", las = 1)
abline(h = 0, v = 0, col = '#888888aa', lwd = 1.5)
title(main = expression(paste(f(x), ' = ', x^2, (x - 1))))
```


### 2.1) Your Turn: Polynomial functions

Write functions and graph the following polynomials in the x-axis interval
-4 to 4:

a. $f(x) = x^3$

```{r}
# your code
polyA = function(x){
  return(x*x*x)
}


# set of points
x <- seq(-4, 4, length.out = 50)
y <- polyA(x)

# graph polynomial
plot(x, y, type = 'l', lwd = 3, col = "#FB7215", las = 1)
abline(h = 0, v = 0, col = '#888888aa', lwd = 1.5)
```

b. $f(x) = (x^2 - 1)(x + 3)^3$

```{r}
# your code
polyB = function(x){
  return(((x+3)^3)*(x^2 - 1))
}
# set of points
x <- seq(-4, 4, length.out = 50)
y <- polyB(x)

# graph polynomial
plot(x, y, type = 'l', lwd = 3, col = "#FB7215", las = 1)
abline(h = 0, v = 0, col = '#888888aa', lwd = 1.5)

```

c. $f(x) = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 9)$

```{r}
# your code
polyC = function(x){
  return((x*x - 1)*(x*x - 9))
}

# set of points
x <- seq(-4, 4, length.out = 50)
y <- polyC(x)

# graph polynomial
plot(x, y, type = 'l', lwd = 3, col = "#FB7215", las = 1)
abline(h = 0, v = 0, col = '#888888aa', lwd = 1.5)
```

## 3) Pythagoras

The pythagoras formula is used to compute the length of the hypotenuse, $c$, of 
a right triangle with legs of length $a$ and $b$.

$$
c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
$$

### 3.1) Your Turn: `pythagoras()` version 1

Write a function `pythagoras()` that takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and 
returns the length of the hypotenuse. Don't forget to include roxygen comments 
to document your function!

Test your `pythagoras()` with two leg values: `pythagoras(3, 4)`

```{r}
#' @title Pythagorean Theorem
#' @description calculates the length of the hypotenuse
#' @param legA length of the first leg (numeric)
#' @param legB width of the second leg (numeric)
#' @return length of hypotenuse
# your pythogras function
pythagoras = function(legA, legB){
  return((legA^2 + legB^2)^.5)
}
pythagoras(3,4)

```


### 3.2) Your Turn: `pythagoras()` version 2

Modify your function `pythagoras()` so that argument `b` takes the same value 
of argument `a`. Test it with just one leg value: `pythagoras(5)`

```{r}
# your modified pythogras function
pythagoras = function(legA = 0, legB=0){
  if(legB == FALSE){
    legB = legA
  }
  return((legA^2 + legB^2)^.5)
}
pythagoras(3,4)
pythagoras(5)
```

## 4) Area of a circle

Consider a circle with `radius = 2`. The area of this circle can be computed
in R as:

```{r}
# area of circle with radius 2
r <- 2
area <- pi * r^2
area
```


### 4.1) Your Turn: `circle_area()` version 1

Write a function `circle_area()` that calculates the area of a circle. This 
function must take one argument `radius`. Give `radius` a default value of 1.
Don't forget to include roxygen comments to document your function!

```{r}
# your code
#' @title Circle Area
#' @description calculates the area of a circle 
#' @param radius length of the radius (numeric)
#' @return circle area
circle_area = function(radius = 1){
  return(pi*radius^2)
}


```

Test your function with:

- `circle_area()`

- `circle_area(radius = 3)`

```{r}
# your tests
circle_area()
circle_area(3)
```


### 4.2) Your Turn: `circle_area()` version 2

Modify your `circle_area()` function in order to include a `stop()` statement.
If `radius` is negative, then the function should stop with a message like:
`"radius cannot be negative"`.

```{r}
# your code
circle_area = function(radius = 1){
  if(radius<0){
    stop("radius cannot be negative")
  }
  return(pi*radius^2)
}
```

Test your modified `circle_area()` with `radius = -2`; the function should 
return a stop message:

```{r}
# your test
circle_area(-2)
```

## 5) Area of a Cylinder

For a given cylinder of radius $r$ and height $h$ the surface area $A$ is given in the following diagram:

#```{r fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, out.width='50%'}
#knitr::include_graphics("lab08-images/surface-area-cylinder.png"#)
#```

For example. Say you have a cylinder with radius = 2, and height = 3.

```{r}
# cylinder variables
r = 2  # radius
h = 3  # height

# area of cylinder
2 * pi * r * h + 2 * pi * r^2
```

Notice that the formula of the area of a cylinder includes the area of a 
circle: $\pi r^2$. 


### 5.1) Your Turn: `cylinder_area()` function

Write a function `cylinder_area()`, that calls `circle_area()`, 
to compute the area of a cylinder. 

```{r}
# area of cylinder
cylinder_area = function(height = 1, radius = 1){
  if(radius<0 | height < 0){
    stop("radius and height must both be positive")
  }
  return((2*circle_area(radius)) + (2*pi*radius*height))
}

```

This function must take two arguments: `radius` and `height`. Give both 
arguments a default value of 1. In addition, the function should stop if any
of `radius` or `height` are negative.

Test your function with:

- `cylinder_area()`

- `cylinder_area(radius = 2, height = 3)`

- `cylinder_area(radius = -2, height = 1)`

- `cylinder_area(radius = 2, height = -1)`

- `cylinder_area(radius = -2, height = -1)`

```{r}
# your tests
cylinder_area()
cylinder_area(radius = 2, height = 3)
cylinder_area(radius = -2, height = 1)
cylinder_area(radius = 2, height = -1)
cylinder_area(radius = -2, height = -1)

```

## 6) Even and Odd Numbers

Any number that can be exactly divided by 2 is called as an __even__ number. 
R provides the modulo operator, `"%%"` that can be used to determine if a 
number is even or odd.

To be more precise, the modulo operator returns the remainder or signed 
remainder of a division.

For example, `4 %% 2` evaluates to 0, because 4 divided by 2 has a quotient of 
2 and a remainder of 0:

```{r}
# 4 is exactly divisible by 2
4 %% 2
```

In contrast, `5 %% 2` would evaluate to 1, because 5 divided by 2 has a 
quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1

```{r}
# 5 is not exactly divisible by 2
5 %% 2
```


### 6.1) Your Turn: Even number

Write a function `is_even()` that determines whether a number is even 
(i.e. multiple of 2). If the input number is even, the output should be 
`TRUE`. If the input number is odd, the output should be `FALSE`. 
If the input is not a number, the output should be `NA` 

```{r}
# your code
is_even= function(num = 0){
  if(typeof(num) != "double"){
    return(NA)
  }
  if(num%%2 == 0){
    return(TRUE)
  }
  if(num%%2 == 1){
    return(FALSE)
  }
}
```

Test your function with:

- `is_even(10)`

- `is_even(33)`

- `is_even('a')`

```{r}
# your tests
is_even(10)

is_even(33)

is_even('a')
```


### 6.2) Your Turn: Odd number

Use your function `is_even()` to write a function `is_odd()` that determines 
if a number is odd (i.e. not a multiple of 2). If a number is odd, the output 
should be `TRUE`; if a number is even the output should be `FALSE`; if the 
input is not a number the output should be `NA`

```{r}
# your code
is_odd = function(num = 0){
  if(typeof(num) != "double"){
    return(NA)
  }
  if(is_even(num)==TRUE){
    return(FALSE)
  }
  if(is_even(num) == FALSE){
    return(TRUE)
  }
}


```

Test `is_odd()` with the following cases:

- `is_odd(1)`

- `is_odd(4)`

- `is_odd('a')`

```{r}
# your tests
is_odd(1)

is_odd(4)

is_odd('a')
```


-----


## 7) If Conditionals

Say you have a number $x$, and you want to compute another number $y$ that 
takes a value depending on $x$ as follows:

$$
y = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if} & x < 0 \\
& \\
x & \text{if} & x \in [0, 100] \\
& \\
100 & \text{if} & x > 100
\end{cases}
$$


### 7.1) Your Turn: `squish()` function

Write a function `squish()` that "squishes" a number into the interval 
$[0, 100]$, so that a number less than 0 is replaced by 0 and a number greater 
than 100 is replaced by 100.

```{r}
# your code
squish = function(x = 0){
  if(x<0){
    return(y = 0)
  }
  else if(x>100){
    return(y = 100)
  }
  else{
    return(y=x)
  }
}

```

Test `squish()` with:

- `squish(-5)`

- `squish(180)`

- `squish(50)`

- `squish(0)`

- `squish(100)`
```{r}
squish(-5)

squish(180)

squish(50)

squish(0)

squish(100)
```
