```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### General Instructions

- Write your descriptions, explanations, and code in an `Rmd` (R markdown) file.
- Name this file as `lab09-first-last.Rmd`, where `first` and `last` are your
first and last names (e.g. `lab09-gaston-sanchez.Rmd`).
- Knit your `Rmd` file as an html document (default option).
- Submit your `Rmd` and `html` files to bCourses, in the corresponding lab assignment.

## About Loops

- Many times we need to perform a procedure several times
- In other words, we have to perform the same operation several times as long as some condition is fulfilled
- For this purpose we use loops
- The main idea is that of __iteration__ or __repetition__
- R provides three basic paradigms to handle this situations: `for`, `repeat`, `while`

### 1) Your Turn: Summation Series

Write a for loop to compute the following series. Your loop should start at 
step $k=0$ and stop at step $n$. Test your code with
different values for $n$. And use a vector to store each k-th term at each 
iteration.


Does the series converge as $n$ increase?

$$
\sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{1}{2^k} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \dots + \frac{1}{2^n}
$$

```{r}
# your code
n = 50
sum = 0
vector =c()
for(k in 0:n){
  sum = sum + (1/(2^k))
  vector = append(vector, sum)
  
}
sum
vector
```

Yes - The series converges to 2
-----


### 2) Your Turn: Arithmetic Series

Write a for loop to compute the following arithmetic series $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$ when $a_1 = 3$, and $d = 3$. For instance: 3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 15 + ...

$$
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
$$


Test your code with different values for $n$. And use a vector to store each 
n-th term at each iteration.
Does the series converge as $n$ increase?

```{r}
# your code
n = 40
d = 3
a1 = 3
an = a1
vector1 = c(a1)
for(i in 1:(n-1)){
  an = an + a1 + (i-1)*d
  vector1 = append(vector1, an)
}
an
vector1
```
does not converge as n increases

-----


### 3) Your Turn: Geometric Sequence

A sequence such as $3, 6, 12, 24, 48$ is an example of a geometric sequence. 
In this type of sequence, the $n$-th term is obtained as: 

$$
a_n = a_1 \times r^{n-1}
$$

where: $a_1$ is the first term, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the number of 
terms.

Write a for loop to compute the sum of the first $n$ terms of:
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + ... 
Test your code with different values for $n$. Does the series converge as $n$ 
increase?

```{r}
# your code
b1 = 3
n = 5
bn = b1
r = 2
vectorB = c(b1)
for(j in 1:(n-1)){
  bn = bn + b1*(r^(j-1))
  vectorB = append(vectorB, bn)
}
bn
vectorB

```

### 4) Your Turn: Sine Approximation

Consider the following series that is used to approximate the function $sin(x)$:

$$
sin(x) \approx x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \dots
$$

Write a `for` loop  to approximate $sin(x)$. Try different number of terms, 
$n = 5, 10, 50, 100$. Compare your results with those of `sin()` function.

```{r}
# your code
x = 3
n = 20
sinx = 0
for(i in 0:n){
  sinx = sinx + (x^(2*i+1))*((-1)^i)/factorial(2*i+1)
}
sinx
sin(3)

```


-----


### 5) Your Turn: Average

The average of $n$ numbers $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ is given by the following 
formula:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n}{n}
$$

Write R code, using both a `for` loop, and a `while` loop, to 
compute the average of the vector `x = 1:100`

```{r}
# your for loop
x = c(1:100)
n5 = length(x)
xSum = 0
for(c in 1:n5){
  xSum = xSum + x[c]
}
xBar = xSum/n5
xBar
```


```{r}
# your while loop
xSum1 = 0
while(n5>0){
  xSum1 = xSum1 + x[n5]
  n5 = n5-1
}
xBar1 = xSum1/length(x)
xBar1


```

### 6) Counting letters until meeting stop condition

Consider the following vector `letrs` which contains various letters:

```{r}
letrs <- c(
  'y', 'd', 'g', 'a', 'b', 'w', 'k', 'n', 'r', 's', 
  'a', 'u', 'u', 'j', 'v', 'n', 'j', 'g', 'i', 'o', 
  'u', 'e', 'i', 'y', 'n', 'e', 'e', 'b', 'j', 'y', 
  'l', 'o', 'a', 't', 'c', 'f', 'j', 'j', 'f', 'o', 
  't', 't', 'z', 'l', 'y', 'w', 'f', 'y', 'h', 'l', 
  'y', 'w', 'x', 'f', 'z', 'g', 's', 'j', 'f', 'x', 
  'n', 'b', 'm', 'r', 'v', 'n', 'f', 'a', 's', 's', 
  'h', 'f', 'w', 'l', 'f', 'h', 'g', 'k', 'q', 'd', 
  'm', 'h', 'y', 'p', 'y', 'w', 'n', 't', 'g', 'm', 
  'v', 'l', 'p', 'a', 'm', 'u', 'f', 'q', 'i', 'g'
)
```


Write a `while()` loop to count the number of letters in `letrs` until reaching 
the fifth occurrence of letter `"y"`. Display such a count.

```{r}
# your code
count = 0
length = 1
while(count<5){
  if(letrs[length] == 'y'){
    count = count +1
  }
  length = length +1
}
length = length -1
length
count
letrs[48]
```
