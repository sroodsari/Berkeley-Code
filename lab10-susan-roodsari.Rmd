### General Instructions

- This lab consists of two parts: 1) computing probabilities, and 2) shiny apps.
- Write your descriptions and code, for the first part of this lab, in an `Rmd` (R markdown) file.
- Name this file as `lab10-first-last.Rmd`, where `first` and `last` are your
first and last names (e.g. `lab10-gaston-sanchez.Rmd`).
- Knit your `Rmd` file as an html document (default option).
- Also, name your app's R script as `app-first-last.R`, where `first` and 
`last` are your first and last names (e.g. `app-gaston-sanchez.R`).
- Submit your `Rmd`, `html`, and `app2.R` files to bCourses, in the corresponding 
lab assignment. BTW: `app2.R` has to be adapted to compute annuities.

# Part I) Future Value and Annuity

In this part, you will have to write functions for 

- computing the future value using the "plain vanilla" formula of compound 
interest,

- computing the future value of an ordinary annuity


## 1) Future Value (Compound Interest)

As discussed in lecture, the most basic formula to compute Future Value
("plain vanilla" compound interest) is given by:

$$
\text{FV} = \text{P} \left( 1 + r \right)^{n}
$$

where: 

- $\text{FV}$ = future value (amount accumulated)
- $\text{P}$ = principal (how much you start with)
- $r$ = annual interest rate (or annual rate of return) 
- $n$ = number of years


-----


### 1.1) Your Turn: function `future_value()`

- Use the formula of the "basic" future value to write a function `future_value()`.

- Give descriptive names to the arguments of the function.

- Also, give default values to the arguments.

- And don't forget to include comments.

```{r}
# your code
#' @title Future Value
#' @description Calculates future value given a principle and rate
#' @param P Principal value
#' @param r annual interest rate
#' @param n number of years
future_value <- function(Principal = 0, rate = 0, years = 0){
  ratePer = rate/100
  return(Principal*(1+ratePer)^(years))
  
}
future_value(100,.005,4)
```


-----


### 1.2) Your turn: using `future_value()`

Paul deposits \$1,000 in a Certificate of Deposit for 5 years at 2% per year compounded annually. What will be the value of the money at the end of 5 years?

```{r}
# your code
future_value(1000,2,5)

```


-----


## 2) Future Value of Annuity

The future value of an annuity is a calculation that measures how much a series 
of fixed contributions (i.e. payments) would be worth at a specific date in the 
future when paired with a particular interest rate (or rate of return). 

There are two flavors of annuities: 

i) __ordinary annuity__, and

ii) __annuity due__

In an ordinary annuity, contributions or payments are made at the end of each 
period. In an annuity due, contributions are made at the beginning of each 
period. Their formulas are given by:

$$
\text{ordinary annuity} \longrightarrow \text{FV} = \text{PMT} \times \frac{ \Big(1 + r \Big)^{n} - 1}{r} \\
$$

$$
\text{annuity due} \longrightarrow \text{FV} = \text{PMT} \times \frac{ \Big(1 + r \Big)^n - 1}{r} \times \Big(1 + r \Big)
$$

where:

- $\text{FV}$ = future value (amount accumulated)
- $\text{PMT}$ = periodic contribution made at the end of each period
- $r$ = annual interest rate (i.e. annual rate of return) 
- $n$ = number of years


-----


### 2.1) Your Turn: function `annuity()`

- Use the formulas given above to write a function `annuity()`, that 
allows you to compute the future value of an annuity. 

- Include an argument `due` that lets you specify whether the annuity
is ordinary (`due = FALSE`) or due (`due = TRUE`).

- Give descriptive names to the arguments of the function.

- Also, give default values to the arguments.

- Don't forget to include comments.

```{r}
# your code
#' @title Future Value of annuity
#' @description compute future value of an annuity
#' @param PMT Periodic contribution
#' @param r annual interest rate
#' @param n number of years
#' @param due logical argument if annuity is ordinary or due
#' @return Annuity
annuity = function(PMT = 0, rate = 0, years = 0, due = FALSE){
  ratePer = rate/100
  if(due == FALSE){
    return(PMT*(((1+ratePer)^years-1)/ratePer))
  }
  else{
    return(PMT*(((1+ratePer)^years-1)/ratePer)*(1+ratePer))
  }
}

```

### 2.2) Your Turn: using `annuity()` 

Use your `annuity()` function to answer the following question.

a) Mr. X deposits an amount of \$1200 at the end of each year for the next ten 
years for his son's education. How much money will Mr. X have at the end 
of ten years if the annual rate of return is 6%?

```{r}
# your code
annuity(1200,6,10,FALSE)
```

b) Mr. and Mrs. Z deposit an amount of \$1200 at the beginning of each year for 
the next ten years for their retirement. How much money will they have at the 
end of ten years if the annual rate of return is 6%?

```{r}
# your code
annuity(1200,6,10,TRUE)

```

# Part II) Shiny Apps

Go to the __Files__ tab in bCourses, click on the folder __shiny-apps__, and
select the __shiny-future-value__. This folder contains three sample shiny apps:

- `app1.R`: sample shiny app for graphing a timeline for Future Value (of 
compound interest).

-  
xc vm,./compound interest) using a randomly generated rate of return.

- `app3.R`: sample shiny app for generating various simulations of future 
values, using randomly generated rates of return, and graphing their timelines.
For example: this can give you an idea of how much money you could expect to 
have in you invest some amount in a given asset that has a rate of return
(with a certain average annual return, and an average annual volatility).


### 3.1) Your Turn: Shiny App for Annuity

Use the sample code in each app (`app1.R`, `app2.R`, `app3.R`) and modify each 
of them to compute __future value of annuity__. You may want to include an 
input widget (for example a `radioButtons` widget) to specify whether to 
calculate an ordinary annuity or an annuity due.

Use your shiny apps to explore the following scenarios:

Say you are going to make periodic annual contributions of \$1200 in some
financial asset, during a certain period of time, for example 10 years:

- contributions can be made at the end of each year

- or at the beginning of every year

Try different values for the annual rate of return, as well as different time
periods: e.g. 10-year period, or 15 years, or after 20 years.
